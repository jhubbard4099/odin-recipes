This project is part of The Odin Project's lesson material.

It involves creating a website using HTML that features some of my favorite recipes. It is intended to show a fundamental understanding of various HTML tags and functionality, as well as overall website structure.

It also now features some CSS formatting additions, bringing some color and page structure layout changes to bring some variety to the site design.
