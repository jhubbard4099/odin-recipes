    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A deliciously creamy chicken, broccoli, and stuffing casserole with shredded chicken and tender broccoli in a cheesy mushroom sauce. Use your favorite stuffing mix to sprinkle over top for a crunchy, flavorful topping. Use leftover chicken or turkey to speed up prep time even more.</p>
    <p><em>Editors Note:</em> Additionally, add fresh craisins for an extra sweetness and depth of flavor!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Chicken:</strong> While the recipe calls for chicken breasts (cooked and shredded), you can use any cut of chicken â€” or even rotisserie chicken to save some prep time.</li>
      <li><strong>Broccoli:</strong> You can use fresh or frozen broccoli because it's cooked before added to the casserole.</li>
      <li><strong>Stuffing Mix:</strong> Use your favorite boxed stuffing here.</li>
      <li><strong>Cream of Mushroom Soup:</strong> The condensed soup will make the casserole extra creamy. While we love to use cream of mushroom, some reviewers like to use cream of chicken soup instead.</li>
      <li><strong>Mayonnaise:</strong> Mixing the mayo and the cream of mushroom soup together will create a moist and creamy casserole.</li>
      <li><strong>Cheddar Cheese:</strong> Combined with the soup mixture, the cheese adds another layer of gooey goodness.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Cook the Chicken:</strong> Simmer chicken in a large pot with water until it's no longer pink inside, about 15 minutes. Shred the chicken. If you're using leftover chicken or rotisserie chicken, simply shred it (no need to cook it again, it will warm up in the oven).</li>
      <li><strong>Make the Soup Base:</strong> Mix the cream of mushroom soup with the mayonnaise.</li>
      <li><strong>Assemble the Casserole:</strong> Combine the soup mixture with the chicken, broccoli, and Cheddar cheese. Transfer it to a 9x13-inch baking dish and top with the stuffing mix.</li>
      <li><strong>Bake the Casserole:</strong> Bake in a 350 degree F oven for about 25-30 minutes, until the stuffing is golden brown.</li>
    </ol>
